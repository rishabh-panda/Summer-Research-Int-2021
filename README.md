## This repository contains the details about the software and study materials that I had used during my Summer Research Internship at IIT Kharagpur:

Kampes, B.M., _"Radar Interferometry - The Persistent Scatterer Technique"_, published by Springer, 2006.

The software consists of a Matlab toolbox.  Matlab must be installed on your system in order to use it.  To install, copy the directory stun and all its contents to a location on your hard disk.  (A zip file is also provided for your convenience.)  Include this directory in the search path of Matlab, e.g., by using the Matlab command "addpath".  Alternatively, start Matlab, and change directories to the installation directory using the command "cd".  Then, from within Matlab, type "help stun" for more information.

To uninstall this software, delete the directory "stun" and all its contents from your hard disk.

For more information, refer to appendix E of the book.
